  abstractNote={Pre-trained deep language models~(LM) have advanced the state-of-the-art of text retrieval. Rerankers fine-tuned from deep LM estimates candidate relevance based on rich contextualized matching signals. Meanwhile, deep LMs can also be leveraged to improve search index, building retrievers with better recall. One would expect a straightforward combination of both in a pipeline to have additive performance gain. In this paper, we discover otherwise and that popular reranker cannot fully exploit the improved retrieval result. We, therefore, propose a Localized Contrastive Estimation (LCE) for training rerankers and demonstrate it significantly improves deep two-stage models.},

  title={ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT}, 
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12832}, 
  DOI={10.48550/arXiv.2004.12832}, 
  abstractNote={Recent progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is driving fast-paced advances in Information Retrieval (IR), largely owed to fine-tuning deep language models (LMs) for document ranking. While remarkably effective, the ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond reducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model, ColBERT’s pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large document collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage search datasets. Results show that ColBERT’s effectiveness is competitive with existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring four orders-of-magnitude fewer FLOPs per query.},

  title={ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction}, 
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01488}, 
  DOI={10.48550/arXiv.2112.01488}, 
  abstractNote={Neural information retrieval (IR) has greatly advanced search and other knowledge-intensive language tasks. While many neural IR methods encode queries and documents into single-vector representations, late interaction models produce multi-vector representations at the granularity of each token and decompose relevance modeling into scalable token-level computations. This decomposition has been shown to make late interaction more effective, but it inflates the space footprint of these models by an order of magnitude. In this work, we introduce ColBERTv2, a retriever that couples an aggressive residual compression mechanism with a denoised supervision strategy to simultaneously improve the quality and space footprint of late interaction. We evaluate ColBERTv2 across a wide range of benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art quality within and outside the training domain while reducing the space footprint of late interaction models by 6--10$times$.},

  DOI={10.48550/arXiv.1901.04085}, 
  abstractNote={Recently, neural models pretrained on a language modeling task, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2017), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), have achieved impressive results on various natural language processing tasks such as question-answering and natural language inference. In this paper, we describe a simple re-implementation of BERT for query-based passage re-ranking. Our system is the state of the art on the TREC-CAR dataset and the top entry in the leaderboard of the MS MARCO passage retrieval task, outperforming the previous state of the art by 27% (relative) in MRR@10. The code to reproduce our results is available at https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4marco-bert},
